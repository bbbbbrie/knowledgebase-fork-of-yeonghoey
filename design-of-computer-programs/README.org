#+TITLE: Design of Computer Programs

* About this Course
This is my study note of the free course named [[https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212][Design of Computer Programs]] from Udacity.

This course teaches how to approach programming problems and how to fight against complexity of programs,
which are the most important skills for all programmer.

The professor, [[http://norvig.com/][Peter Norvig]], teaches these skills through pose-try-feedback loop.

The lessons consists of small programming problems.
He make us solve them first, and shows his own solution as feedback.
Most of time, I was surprised at his elegant solutions.

This is my one of the most favorite computer courses of all time.
