Unlike the language model previously introduced, in machine translation,
pick most likely ~y~ instead of sampling for consistent results.

Don't use greedy approach, otherwise ~Jane is going~, which is less succinct in the above example, will always be chosen.

** Beam Search

In the second step, pick the top 3 again among 30,000 possibilities.
Because Beam width is 3, every step needs 3 models.

** Refinements to Beam Search

The actual probability is too small to practically calculate.
So take log to the probabilities
