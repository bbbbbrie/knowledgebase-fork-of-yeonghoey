* The Four Basic Principles
** Proximity
[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-15_08-55-08.png]]

- Items relating to each other should be grouped together
- The basic purpose of proximity is to organize
- If there are more than three to five items on the page(of course it depends on the piece),
  see which of the separate elements can be grouped together into close proximity
  to become one visual unit
- Avoid too many separate elements on a page
- Don't stick things in the corners or in the middle just because the space is empty

** Alignment
** Repetition
** Contrast
