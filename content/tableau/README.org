* How-to
** Use Level of Detail Expressions
- ~{FIXED [Department] : AVG([Sales])}~ ::
  the average ~Sales~ per ~Department~
- ~{INCLUDE [Item] : AVG([Sales])}~ ::
  the average ~Sales~ at the level of detail defined in the view but includes the dimension ~Item~
- ~{EXCLUDE [Category] : AVG([Sales])}~ ::
  the average ~Sales~ at the level of detail defined in the view but does not include the dimension ~Category~

Consider a dataset like:
#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {"User": "foo", "Programming Language": "Python"}
  {"User": "foo", "Programming Language": "R"}
  {"User": "bar", "Programming Language": "Go"}
#+END_SRC

Use LOD Expressions to answer **How many users use how many languages?**

** Create a dimension of Top N and Others
- To achieve this, we need to create a set first, and ~IF~ expression with it.
