* Notes
** About
A personal knowledge base.
Most notes are about tech, but I'm trying to write about everything I learned.
The notes are mostly written in [[http://orgmode.org/][org]] format.

** Goals
- Can lookup things faster
- Can find out concepts faster
- Can write notes faster

** Principles
- More Examples, less descriptions
- Up to 2 levels deep of tree hierarchy
- No obsession with perfection of categorization
