- Blue, red, green each stand for 1st, 2nd, 3rd choice.
- Each bar stands for a member, in alphabetical order.
- This visualization gives the insight that the students(voters) might not have cared the order of their choice.
- Like this, providing insight into data is the hallmark of data visualization.

* Lesson 1-1: Introduction
** 1.1.1. Some books on Data Visualization
There are a lot of books. From his comments,
I decided to care the last book, because he acclaimed the book a lot in many perspective.

- Vertex Processing :: after transform and lighting, projects vertices of triangles onto an image plane.
- Rasterization     :: takes the 2d triangles from prior step and converts them into pixels.
- Pixel Processing  :: figures out what colors should be on the pixels from prior step.
