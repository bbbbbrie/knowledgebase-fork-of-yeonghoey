* Event
- Events are bubbled up the event chain. (sometimes, it's called delegation or propagation)
- Some events have their default actions. (putting letters when ~keypress~ within ~<input>~, refreshing the page when ~click~ within submit element, etc.)
- Call ~stopPropagation~ to prevent the event from bubbling
- Call ~preventDefault~ to prevent the default action.

  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    function handler(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      event.stopPropagation();
    }
  #+END_SRC
