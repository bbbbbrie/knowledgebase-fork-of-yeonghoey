* Lesson 2-1: Data, Mapping, and Charts
** 2.1.1. Data
[[file:_slides/2.1.1.pdf::16by9]]

- Ordinal: We only know something is bigger than the other, but we don't know how much bigger it is.

I'm not familiar with Data Warehouses. So I found a concept image ([[https://www.slideshare.net/algum/data-cubes-7923771][ref]]):

(Listed in Preferred Order)

- Color features are hard to be perceived how much one thing is stronger than the other, but they are easily distinguished, so it's effective for Ordinal data.

** 2.1.3. Charts

- On the right, it's easy to see that the red variable is not chaning across the x-axis.
- On the left, it's harder.
- The ~Position~ is a stronger indicator than the ~Length~.


** 2.2.3. Stacked Graphs: Part 2

* Lesson 2-3: Tufte's Design Rules and Using Color
** 2.3.1. Tufte's Design Rules

- Instead of interpolating or something, let the viewer reason about the missing data.

- A picture is worth a thousand words.
- Label your axes!
- Label should stand out from data
- Making a visualization look prettier often makes it less effective at communicating its data

** 2.3.2. Using Color
[[file:_slides/2.3.2.pdf::16by9]]

- Prefer HSV over RGB
- Hues are good for representing Nominal variables
