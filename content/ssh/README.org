- This process is mostly by RSA algorithm
  - (m^{e})^{d}\equiv m (mod n) 
  - (m^{d})^{e}\equiv m (mod n)
  - ~Public key~ consists of ~(e, n)~
  - ~Private key~ consists of ~(d, n)~
  - Finding ~d~ from ~e~ and ~n~ is hard
  - ~e~ stands for ~public exponent~, and [[https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/52df25cf2e656146cb3b206d8220124f0417d03f/include/openssl/rsa.h#L46][OpenSSL]] sets it as ~65537~ (~0x10001~) by default

** Fingerprints
If the *fingerprint changes*:
- The machine *has changed their public key* (because ~public exponent~ can vary, there can be multiple valid public keys).
- It could also indicate that you are *connecting to a different machine* at the same domain/IP
- It could also indicate that you are *being targeted with a man-in-the-middle attack*

* How-to
** Get the public key from a private key
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -y > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
#+END_SRC
