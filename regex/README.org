* Escaping required characters for literal meaning
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/399078/what-special-characters-must-be-escaped-in-regular-expressions

** PCRE, ERE, and other compatibles
- Tools like ~ag~, ~rg~, ~egrep~, ~grep -E~
- Just most common symbols: ~.^$*+?()[{\|~
- Because ~\~ is a literal chracter inside character classes, ~^-]\~ should be escaped by clever placement
  - ~^~: Except at the start
  - ~]~: At the start
  - ~-~: At the start or the end of the character class

** BRE (POSIX Basic Regular Expressions)
- Tools like ~grep~
- Only basical anchors and glob symbols: ~.^$*~
