| ~[:cntrl:]~  | Octal codes ~000~ through ~037~, and ~177~ (DEL)                                           |
| ~\b~         | Match the empty string at the edge of a word                                               |
| ~\B~         | Match the empty string provided it’s not at the edge of a word.                            |
| ~\<~         | Match the empty string at the beginning of word.                                           |
| ~\>~         | Match the empty string at the end of word.                                                 |
| ~\w~         | A synonym for ~[_[:alnum:]]~                                                               |
| ~\W~         | A synonym for ~[^_[:alnum:]]~                                                              |
| ~\s~         | A synonym for ~[[:space:]]~                                                                    |
| ~\S~         | A synonym for ~[^[:space:]]~                                                               |
| ~(a)\1~      | Matches ~aa~ (Back references)                                                             |
| ~a(.)¦b\1~   | will not match ~ba~ (Only groups participated in the match can be back-referenced)         |

- ~\<~, ~\>~ is specific, while ~\b~ can be placed at both ends
- Meta-characters like ~?~, ~+~, ~{~, ~|~, ~(~, ~)~ should be escaped with backslash
  - ~egrep~ or ~grep -E~ will make these characters have meta meaning by default.

** Meta Characters that require escaping when using as literal characters
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/399078/what-special-characters-must-be-escaped-in-regular-expressions

*** PCRE, ERE, and other compatibles
- Tools like ~ag~, ~rg~, ~egrep~, ~grep -E~
- Just most common symbols: ~.^$*+?()[{\|~
- Because ~\~ is a literal chracter inside character classes, ~^-]\~ should be escaped by clever placement
  - ~^~: Except at the start
  - ~]~: At the start
  - ~-~: At the start or the end of the character class

*** BRE (POSIX Basic Regular Expressions)
- Tools like ~grep~
- Only basical anchors and glob symbols: ~.^$*~
