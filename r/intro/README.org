- R is case sensitive
- Symbols: ~[A-Za-z][.0-9A-Za-z_]*~ or ~[.]([A-Za-z][.0-9A-Za-z_]*)?~
- Strings can be expressed by ~'~ or ~"~. ~"~ is preferred.
- Commands are separated either by a semi-colon(~;~) or by a newline(~\n~).
- Commands can be grouped by braces(~{}~)
- Comments can be put almost everywhere, staring with ~#~

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  # execute R code in the file. Same as shells.
  source("commands.R")
  objects()    # stored names in the current session
  rm(x, y, z)  # remove the name from the session
