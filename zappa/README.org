It seems that Zappa packages all files in the current working directory.
So, it doesn't need to ~pip install .~ to include the project code.

* How-to
** Configure HTTPS using AWS Certificate Manager
- https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa#ssl-certification

I don't know why, but Zappa only supports ACM in ~us-east-1~.
So, make sure to use the proper region when registering ACM.

#+BEGIN_SRC json
    "dev": {
      "certificate_arn": "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:1234:certificate/abcd",
      "domain": "dev.galpi.io",
    }
#+END_SRC

I'm not sure whether it is safe to publish aws arn in a public git repository.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ zappa certify
#+END_SRC
