#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  Success! your project is now initialized with awsmobilejs

     awsmobilejs/.awsmobile
       is the workspace of awsmobile-cli, please do not modify its contents

     awsmobilejs/#current-backend-info
       contains information of the backend awsmobile project from the last
       synchronization with the cloud

     awsmobilejs/backend
       is where you develop the codebase of the backend awsmobile project

     awsmobile console
       opens the web console of the backend awsmobile project

     awsmobile run
       pushes the latest development of the backend awsmobile project to the cloud,
       and runs the frontend application locally

     awsmobile publish
       pushes the latest development of the backend awsmobile project to the cloud,
       and publishes the frontend application to aws S3 for hosting

  Happy coding with awsmobile!

It seems that ~<project>/awsmobilejs/backend/mobile-hub-project.yml~ defines the backend settings.
However, I couldn't find any reference guide to write it by myself.
So, I think the best way to configure the backed is to use the web console UI, and ~awsmobile pull~ to sync.
