** EBS-Optimized Instances
- To *ensure sustained reliable network bandwidth* between your EC2 instance and your EBS volumes:
  - To launch the EC2 instance as *EBS-optimized* 
  - To choose an instance type with *10 Gigabit network connectivity*(like ~r4.8xtype~).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Be sure to choose an EBS-optimized instance that provides more dedicated EBS throughput than your application needs;
otherwise, the Amazon EBS to Amazon EC2 connection will become a performance bottleneck.

When EBS-Optimized, Each instance can acquire IO Performance following:

** io1: For the best per-I/O latency experience
We recommend that you provision an IOPS-to-GiB ratio *greater than 2:1*.
For example, a 2,000 IOPS volume *should be smaller than 1,000 GiB*.

** io1: Within 10 percent of the provisioned IOPS performance?
- Ambiguous wording

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
if you provision a volume with 5,000 IOPS,
Amazon EBS delivers an average of 4,500 IOPS or higher for 99.9 percent of the time over a year.
I think the document's wrong. They should edit it like "within 90%".
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It's more like this: 99.9% of the time over the year, AWS will deliver within 4000 IOPS +(?)/- 10%.
