** Deep Selectors
- Keep using classes for performance efficiency
- Be careful with descendant selectors in recursive components
- With ~scoped~, the parent component's styles will not leak into child components.
- However, a child component's root node will be affected by both the parent's scoped CSS and the child's scoped CSS.

To affect child components, use ~>>>~ combinator
#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <template>
    <div id="parent">
    </div>
  </template>

  <style scoped>
  #parent >>> .child { /* ... */ }
  </style>
#+END_SRC
