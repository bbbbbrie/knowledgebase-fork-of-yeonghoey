* The Four Basic Principles
** Proximity

- Items relating to each other should be grouped together
- The basic purpose of proximity is to organize
- If there are more than three to five items on the page(of course it depends on the piece),
  see which of the separate elements can be grouped together into close proximity
  to become one visual unit
- *Avoid too many separate elements* on a page
- *Don't stick things in the corners or in the middle* just because the space is empty

** Alignment

- When items are aligned on the page, the result is *a stronger cohesive unit*
- Get in *the habit of drawing lines* between elements to determine where the connections are lacking

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A centered alignment often appears a bit weak.
If text is aligned, instead, on the left or the right,
the invisible line that connects the text is much stronger
because it has a hard vertical edge to follow. This give left- and right-aligned text
a cleaner and more dramatic look.

- The author's name is far from the title, but that invisible line connects the two text blocks.

** Repetition
** Contrast

* Design with Color
* Design with Type
