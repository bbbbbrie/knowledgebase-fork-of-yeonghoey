* How-to
** Modify EBS Volume
- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console

1. Do Actions -> Modify Volume.
2. Change settings, like size.
3. Run ~sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1~ to resize the running file system

** Enable ENA on Ubuntu
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking-ena.html

* Topics
** Key Pairs 
*** Fingerprint
- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html
- Created the key pair using AWS: the fingerprint is calculated using ~SHA-1~
- Imported a public key: the fingerprint is calculated using ~MD5~

** Status Checks
- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html

*** System Status Checks
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
require AWS involvement to repair. (...)
*wait for AWS to fix the issue*, or you can resolve it yourself.
(by *stopping and starting an instance*, or by *terminating and replacing an instance*).
#+END_QUOTE

- Loss of network connectivity
- Loss of system power
- Software issues on the physical host
- Hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability

*** Instance Status Checks
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
require your involvement to repair. (...)
(by *rebooting the instance* or by *making instance configuration changes*).
#+END_QUOTE

- Failed system status checks
- Incorrect networking or startup configuration
- Exhausted memory
- Corrupted file system
- Incompatible kernel

** Enhanced Networking on Linux
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking

*** Single-root IO virtualization(SR-IOV)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_input/output_virtualization
- SR-IOV is a network interface that allows the isolation of the PCI Express resources for manageability and performance reasons.
- Reduces CPU utilization for processing network traffic
- Reduces latency path
- Increases throughput
