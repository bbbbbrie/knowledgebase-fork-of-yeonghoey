* The Four Design Principles
+ Don't be afraid to *create your design with plenty of blank space*
+ Don't be afraid to *be asymmetrical, to uncenter your format*
+ Don't be afraid to *make words very large or very small*
+ Don't be afraid to *make your graphics very bold or very minimal*

** Proximity

If there are more than three to five items on the page(of course it depends on the piece),
*see which of the separate elements can be grouped together* into close proximity
to become one visual unit

-----

+ *To organize*
+ Items relating to each other *should be grouped together*
+ *Avoid too many separate elements* on a page
+ *Don't stick things in the corners or in the middle* just because the space is empty

-----

** Alignment

When items are aligned on the page, the result is *a stronger cohesive unit* (...)
Get in *the habit of drawing lines* between elements to determine where the connections are lacking

*A centered alignment often appears a bit weak*.
If text is aligned, instead, on the left or the right,
the invisible line that connects the text is much stronger
because it has a hard vertical edge to follow.
This give *left- and right-aligned text a cleaner and more dramatic look.*

The author's name is far from the title, but *that invisible line connects the two text blocks*.

If you're going to center text, then *at least make it obvious that it is centered!*

Until you have more training, stick to this guideline: *Choose one.*
That is, choose one text alignment on the page.

-----

*Never center headlines over flush left body copy or text that has an indent*
because if the text does not have clear left and right edges, you cannot tell
that the headline is actually centered. It looks random.

*First paragraphs are traditionally not indented.* The purpose of indenting a paragraph is
to tell you there is a new paragraph, but you already know the first paragraph is a new paragraph.
*The professional typographic indent is one em, which is about two spaces, not five*.

*Find a strong line and use it.* If you have a photo or a graphic with a strong flush side,
align the side of the text along the straight edge of the photo, (...)
however, there is "trapped" white space, and the white space is an awkward shape, (...)
*The whitespace now is floating free of the right edge.*

-----

+ *To unify and organize the page.*
+ Avoid using *more than one text alignment on the page*

-----

** Repetition
[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-16_08-24-22.png]]

-----

+ *To unify and to add visual interest*
+ Avoid repeating the element *so much that it becomes annoying or overwhelming.*

At first, simple find existing repetitions and then strengthen them.
As you get used to the idea and the look, start to create
repetitions to enhance the design and the clarity of the information.

-----

** Contrast
[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-16_08-36-15.png]]

Contrast various elements of the piece *to draw a reader's eye* into the page. (...)
*Contrast not only serves to draw in the eye, but you can use it to organize information*,
clarify the hierarchy, guide a reader around the page, and provide a focus.

If two elements are sort of different *but not really, then you don't have contrast, you have conflict*.

-----

*Find the most interesting or most important item on the page, and emphasize it!*

-----

+ *To create an interest* on the page and *to aid in the organization* of the information
+ If the items are not exactly the same, *make them different!*

-----

* Color
The most practical thing to remember is that cool colors recede into the background,
and warm colors come forward.

Does your project include a photograph or other image?
Pick up a color in the photograph and choose a range of other colors based on that.

CYMK is the color model you'll use for projects that are going to be printed by a printing
press onto something physical.

In the world, the spectrum of visible light hits objects.
Objects absorb (or subtract) most of the spectrum -
what they don't absorb reflects back to our eyes as color.
On a monitor, however, the colors of light are not reflected - 
they go directly into our eyes.

One of the most important features of an identity package or branding follows
the Principle of Repetition

Because each booklet is completely redesigned, it was critical that there be something
to tie them all together

One element should be dominant, and it should be dominant in the same way
on the letterhead, the envelope, and the business card.

The biggest problems with most flyers created by new designers are a lack of contrast and
a presentation of information that has no hierarchy

After the focal point, *use strong subheads* (strong visually and strong in what it says)
*so readers can quickly scan the flyer* to determine the point of the message

The white space needs to be as organized as the visible elements.
Let it be there, and let it flow.

First paragraphs, even after subheads, should not be indented.
When you do indent, use the standard typographic indent of one "em" space.

The Helvetica or Arial that came with your computer isn't bold enough to create a strong contrast.

Invest in a sans serif family that includes a heavy black version as well as a light version
(such as Eurostile, Formatat, Syntax, Frutiger, or Myriad)

try a classic oldstyle serif face(such as Garamond, Jenson, Caslon, Minion, or Palatino),
or a lightweight slab serif(such as Clarendon, Bookman, Kepler, or New Century Schoolbook)

It's important to be aware of the folds; you don't want important information disappearing into the creases.
If you have a strong alignment for the text on each panel of the brochure, however, feel free to
let the graphics cross over the space between the columns of text(the gutter) and into the fold

* Type
One space after punctuation
Yes, you might have the old-fashioned habit of typing two spaces after punctuation,
but it is long past time to let that go. It doesn't matter today
where the practice originated or for how long typesetters used larger spaces
between sentences. Today the standard is one space.

Another glaring mistake of amateur designers is the use of typewriter quotation marks instead of typographer
quote marks.

In the United States, commas and periods are always inside the quotation marks.
Colons and semicolons go outside the quotation marks.

A question mark or exclamation point goes inside the quotation marks
if it belongs to the quotation:"Get out of my reality!"

The question mark or exclamation point goes outside the quotation marks
if it does not belong to the quoted phrase: Can you believe he replied, "I won't do it"?

The most common mistakes with apostrophes are 
+ using a typewrite mark and
+ putting the apostrophe in the wrong place

Apostrophes are shaped like 9s


tiny litte dash that belongs in some words such as daughter-in-law or in phone numbers

A hyphen is for hyphenating words or line breaks.

En dash(short dash) 
The en dash is approximately the width of a capital letter N in the font and size you are typing,
thus it is longer than the hyphen.
Use it between words that indicate a duration, such as hourly time or
months or years. Use it where you would otherwise use the word "to".

Also use the en dash when you have a compound adjective and one of the elements is made of
two words or a hyphenated word:

Em dash(long dash)
The em dash is twice as long as the en dash, approximately the width of a capital letter M.
This dash is often used to indicate an abrupt change of thought or in a sentence where a period is too strong
and a comma too weak.
The em dash does not have a space on either side.

To type the dashes, see the charts on the following pages.

Capitals
When a block of text is in all caps, we have to read it letter by letter rather than
by the shpaes of groups of letters

"I really want the text for my logo set as one rectangular piece."


Underlining
Do not use the underline button. Ever.

Underline was originally a visual clue on a typewriter to tell the typesetter who was creating the project that
the underlined word was to be turned into italic for print.

You might also be in the habit of underlining words that you want to emphasize. However, you have several
other options for emphasis that are more professional: try bold type, larger type, a different font, color, or a combination.

if you are aspiring to a professional level, you need to learn to manually adjust the spacing.

When the last line of a paragraph has fewer than seven (more or less, depending on the length of the line) characters,
that last line is a widow.

When the last line of a paragraph, be it ever so long, ends at the top of the next column or page all by itself,
abandoned by the rest of its text, that is an orphan.

To avoid widows and orphans, you might need to rewrite copy, or at least add or delete a word or two.

Punctuation following styled text: the punctuation immediately following the last character should be in the same style.

If the text inside the parentheses is part of the entire sentence, the punctuation goes outside the closing parenthesis (as in this example right here).

If the text inside the parentheses is a complete and separate sentence on its own, its punctuation goes inside.
(This is an example of a sentence with its punctuation inside.)
