#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For Lambda or HTTP proxy integrations, you can still set up the required ~OPTIONS~ response headers in API Gateway. However, you must rely on the back end to return the ~Access-Control-Allow-Origin~ headers because the integration response is disabled for the proxy integration.
#+END_QUOTE

** Deployments
- Deployment :: assoicated with a stage
- Stage :: a snapshot of API
  - adjusting the default account-level
  - request throttling limits 
  - enabling API caching. 
  - Stages enable robust version control of your API
- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/canary-release.html][Canary release]] :: updated version on the same stage

*** Logging
*** Variables
- Using stage variables you can configure an API deployment stage to interact with different backend endpoints.
- When you call your ~beta~ endpoint, API Gateway uses the stage variable for the ~beta~ stage, and calls a different web host (for example, ~beta.example.com~)

** Proxy
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
With the Lambda proxy integration, when a client submits an API request,
API Gateway passes to the integrated Lambda function the raw request as-is.
This request data includes the request headers, query string parameters, URL path variables, payload, and API configuration data.
*The configuration data can include current deployment stage name, stage variables, user identity, or authorization context (if any)*
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You can set up a Lambda proxy integration for any API method.
But a Lambda proxy integration is more potent when it is configured for an API method involving a generic proxy resource.
The generic proxy resource can be denoted by a special templated path variable of ~{proxy+}~, the catch-all ~ANY~ method placeholder, or both. 
#+END_QUOTE

- ~ANY /{proxy+}~
- ~ANY /res~
- ~GET|POST|PUT|... /{proxy+}~
- ~GET|POST|PUT|... /res/{path}/...~
- ~GET|POST|PUT|... /res~

The ~/parent/{proxy+}~ placeholder stands for any resource matching the path pattern of ~/parent/*~.

Configuring ~/{proxy+}~ as a proxy resource catches all requests to its sub-resources.
For example, it works for a GET request to ~/foo~. To handle requests to ~/~, add a new ~ANY~ method on the ~/~ resource.

When a proxy resource has non-proxy siblings, *the sibling resources are excluded from the representation of the proxy resource.*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  /{proxy+}
  /parent/{proxy+}
  /parent/{child}/{proxy+}
#+END_EXAMPLE

The request data format is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
      "resource": "Resource path",
      "path": "Path parameter",
      "httpMethod": "Incoming request's method name"
      "headers": {Incoming request headers}
      "queryStringParameters": {query string parameters }
      "pathParameters":  {path parameters}
      "stageVariables": {Applicable stage variables}
      "requestContext": {Request context, including authorizer-returned key-value pairs}
      "body": "A JSON string of the request payload."
      "isBase64Encoded": "A boolean flag to indicate if the applicable request payload is Base64-encode"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

The desired output format is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
      "isBase64Encoded": true|false,
      "statusCode": httpStatusCode,
      "headers": { "headerName": "headerValue", ... },
      "body": "..."
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE
