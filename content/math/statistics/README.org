** Why we divide by n-1 for the unbiased sample
- Since we usually don't know the real =mu=, the population mean.
- So, we resort to use the sample mean to calculate the sample variance.
- The problem is:
  1. Since the sample size is smaller than the population size
  2. it is more likely that the values are more close to each other.
  3. Therefore, ~sum((x - x_bar)^2)~ is usually smaller.
- To compensate this, divide by ~n-1~, which results in the larger value.
