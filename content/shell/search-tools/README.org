| ~a(.)¦b\1~   | will not match ~ba~ (Only groups participated in the match can be back-referenced)         |

- ~\<~, ~\>~ is specific, while ~\b~ can be placed at both ends
- Meta-characters like ~?~, ~+~, ~{~, ~|~, ~(~, ~)~ should be escaped with backslash
  - ~egrep~ or ~grep -E~ will make these characters have meta meaning by default.

:END:

*** PCRE, ERE, and other compatibles
- Tools like ~ag~, ~rg~, ~egrep~, ~grep -E~
- Common meta characters: ~.^$*+?()[{\|~
- Because ~\~ is a literal chracter inside character classes, ~^-]\~ should be escaped by clever placement
  - ~^~: Except at the start
  - ~]~: At the start
  - ~-~: At the start or the end of the character class

*** BRE (POSIX Basic Regular Expressions)
- Tools like ~grep~
- Only basical anchors and glob symbols: ~.^$*~
