* Details
** fingerprint
- https://superuser.com/questions/421997/what-is-a-ssh-key-fingerprint-and-how-is-it-generated
If the *fingerprint changes*, the machine you are connecting to *has changed their public key*.
This may not be a bad thing(happens from re-installing ssh),
But it could also indicate that you are *connecting to a different machine* at the same domain/IP or
that you are *being targeted with a man-in-the-middle attack*

* Use Cases
** Get the public key from a private key
