One of my lifetime goals is to make an influential indie game based on data science, including machine learning.

Since I was 11, when I was fascinated by games, my life is deeply connected to games.
My parents supported me to pursue it, and I could learn Turbo Pascal and Turbo C when I was kid.


I was fascinated by games since I was 7. Since then, I'd been dreaming of becoming a game developer.

I told my dream to my parents. They supported me to pursue my dream. 

I could attend a computer academies to learn computer algorithms.
After 1-2 years of learning them, when I was a middle school student, 
I even participated regional preliminaries of International Olympiad in Informatics.

But I didn't get any noticeable result, because I was not so interested in them.
The middle school student of me couldn't related computer science and game development.
It was another boring math problem at that moment.

I quit to continue my effort to algorithms at high school.
I shifted my goal as becoming a game designer.


like being more fluent in English, joining the bleeding edge, bU.S is setting the pace of my profession thesedays.

I think my forte is to find my curiosity in any task. 
Following my curiosity, I've been teaching myself and being successful during my career.

When I was a junior game developer, working on the matchmaking system for Bubble Fighter,
I had to research TrueSkill, a player rating algorithm, based on Bayesian statistical inference.
Apart from its complex nature, it was almost impossible for a junior developer to understand, design and implement the whole system.

But my curiosity led me to read over all the related papers.
It made me lookup all the mathematical symbols I was not familiar with on those papers.
I got to lots of 
to try lots of examples of the algorithm.



I've read lots CS books, taking lots of courses from Coursera and Udacity.


The broad range of successful achievements in my career proves the point.
