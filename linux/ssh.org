** How SSH works

*** Establishes a session key with Diffie-Hellman algorithm

- Used to encrypt the entire session

*** Authenticates the User's Access

- This process is by RSA algorithm
- {\displaystyle (m^{e})^{d}\equiv m{\pmod {n}}}
- {\displaystyle (m^{d})^{e}\equiv m{\pmod {n}}}


** fingerprint
- https://superuser.com/questions/421997/what-is-a-ssh-key-fingerprint-and-how-is-it-generated
If the *fingerprint changes*, the machine you are connecting to *has changed their public key*.
This may not be a bad thing(happens from re-installing ssh),
But it could also indicate that you are *connecting to a different machine* at the same domain/IP or
that you are *being targeted with a man-in-the-middle attack*

* Use Cases
