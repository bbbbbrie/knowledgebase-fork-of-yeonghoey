- It does "copy" *functions and classes*
- Use ~dict.copy()~ or ~list[:]~ to create a shallow copy of ~dict~ and ~list~
- Classes can define special methods ~__copy__()~ and ~__deepcopy__()~


- shallow ::
  inserts references into a new object to the objects found in the original.

- deep ::
  recursively inserts copies into a new object of the objects found in the original.
  /Recursive objects may cause a recursive loop./
