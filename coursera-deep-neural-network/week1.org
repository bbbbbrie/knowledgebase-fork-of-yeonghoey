Traditionally, 7:3 (train:dev) or 6:2:2 (train:dev:test), is a rule of thumb for data set.
But, in these days, big data came out, and there are a lot more data than past.
We can decrease dev and test data portion ratio, because the size of data set would just be enough in absolute perspective
with a big data set.

- Training Set :: This data set is used to adjust the weights on the neural network.

- Validation(Dev) Set ::
  This data set is used to minimize overfitting.
  If the accuracy over the training data set increases,
  but the accuracy over then validation data set stays the same or decreases,
  then you're overfitting your neural network and you should stop training.

- Testing Set :: This data set is used *only for testing the final solution in order to confirm the actual predictive power* of the network.

Make sure that the dev and test sets come from the same distribution.
