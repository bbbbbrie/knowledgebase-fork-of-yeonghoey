* Topic
** Is it safe to expose ARN in a public git repo?
- https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/70hqby/is_it_safe_to_expose_aws_arns_in_a_public_git_repo/
- ARNs by themselves generally are fine to publish
- But, it smells bad.

** Tagging
- https://aws.amazon.com/ko/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/

- Use a consistent, standardized, case-sensitive format for tags across all resource types.
- Tag dimensions for manage resource access control, cost tracking, automation, and organization.
- Implement automated tools to help manage resource tags.
- Err on the side of using too many tags rather than too few tags.
