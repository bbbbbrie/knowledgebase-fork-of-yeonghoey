* Cross Product
- Only in three-dimensional space
- The cross product ~a Ã— b~ is defined as a vector ~c~ that is perpendicular to both ~a~ and ~b~

*** 2D Game Use Case
- Cross product of two 2D vectors is not a 2D vector; instead, *it is a scalar*.
- *The sign of the cross product of 2D vectors* tells you
- *whether the second vector is on the left or right side* of the first vector

#+BEGIN_SRC csharp
  float cross(const Vec2 &a, const Vec2 &b)
  {
      return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;
  }
#+END_SRC
