* The Four Design Principles
+ Don't be afraid to *create your design with plenty of blank space*
+ Don't be afraid to *be asymmetrical, to uncenter your format*
+ Don't be afraid to *make words very large or very small*
+ Don't be afraid to *make your graphics very bold or very minimal*

** Proximity
[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-15_08-55-08.png]]

If there are more than three to five items on the page(of course it depends on the piece),
*see which of the separate elements can be grouped together* into close proximity
to become one visual unit

-----

+ *To organize*
+ Items relating to each other *should be grouped together*
+ *Avoid too many separate elements* on a page
+ *Don't stick things in the corners or in the middle* just because the space is empty

-----

** Alignment

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-15_09-04-29.png]]

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-15_09-04-53.png]]

When items are aligned on the page, the result is *a stronger cohesive unit* (...)
Get in *the habit of drawing lines* between elements to determine where the connections are lacking

*A centered alignment often appears a bit weak*.
If text is aligned, instead, on the left or the right,
the invisible line that connects the text is much stronger
because it has a hard vertical edge to follow.
This give *left- and right-aligned text a cleaner and more dramatic look.*

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-15_09-05-21.png]]

The author's name is far from the title, but *that invisible line connects the two text blocks*.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-16_08-05-43.png]]

If you're going to center text, then *at least make it obvious that it is centered!*

Until you have more training, stick to this guideline: *Choose one.*
That is, choose one text alignment on the page.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-16_08-10-08.png]]

*Never center headlines over flush left body copy or text that has an indent*
because if the text does not have clear left and right edges, you cannot tell
that the headline is actually centered. It looks random.

*First paragraphs are traditionally not indented.* The purpose of indenting a paragraph is
to tell you there is a new paragraph, but you already know the first paragraph is a new paragraph.
*The professional typographic indent is one em, which is about two spaces, not five*.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-16_08-17-06.png]]

*Find a strong line and use it.* If you have a photo or a graphic with a strong flush side,
align the side of the text along the straight edge of the photo, (...)
however, there is "trapped" white space, and the white space is an awkward shape, (...)
*The whitespace now is floating free of the right edge.*

-----

+ *To unify and organize the page.*
+ Avoid using *more than one text alignment on the page*

-----

** Repetition
[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-16_08-24-22.png]]

-----

+ *To unify and to add visual interest*
+ Avoid repeating the element *so much that it becomes annoying or overwhelming.*

At first, simple find existing repetitions and then strengthen them.
As you get used to the idea and the look, start to create
repetitions to enhance the design and the clarity of the information.

-----

** Contrast
[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-16_08-36-15.png]]

Contrast various elements of the piece *to draw a reader's eye* into the page. (...)
*Contrast not only serves to draw in the eye, but you can use it to organize information*,
clarify the hierarchy, guide a reader around the page, and provide a focus.

If two elements are sort of different *but not really, then you don't have contrast, you have conflict*.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-16_08-49-26.png]]

*Find the most interesting or most important item on the page, and emphasize it!*

-----

+ *To create an interest* on the page and *to aid in the organization* of the information
+ If the items are not exactly the same, *make them different!*

-----

* Color

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_14-00-46.png]]

| Primary colors   | [[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_10-45-36.png]] |
| Secondary colors | [[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_10-46-38.png]] |
| Tertiary colors  | [[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_10-48-56.png]] |

*Complementary*: often works best when one is the *main color and the other is an accent*.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_14-27-11.png]]

The *primary triad* of R, G, B is an extremely popular combination for *children's products*.

All *triads* (except the primary triad) have underlying colors connecting them,
which make them harmonize well.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_14-41-57.png]]

*Split complement triads* create a little more sophisticated edge to it.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_14-37-48.png]]

Analogous colors create *harmonious combination*.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_14-43-40.png]]

The pure color is the *hue*.
Add black to a hue to create a *shade*.
Add white to a hue to create a *tint*.

Using various tints and shades of colors expands your options tremendously,
but you can still feel safe that the colors work together.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_10-41-16.png]]

*Cool colors recede into the background*, and *warm colors come forward*.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_10-35-32.png]]

Does your project include a photograph or other image?
Pick up a color in the photograph and choose a range of other colors based on that.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the world, the spectrum of visible light hits objects.
Objects absorb (or subtract) most of the spectrum -
what they don't absorb reflects back to our eyes as color.
On a monitor, however, the colors of light are not reflected - 
they go directly into our eyes.
Mixing colors in CMYK is like mixing paint on a palette.
#+END_QUOTE

*CYMK* is the color model you'll use for projects
that are going to be printed by a printing press onto something physical.

-----

* Type Basics

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-34-38.png]]

*Concordant*: use only one type family without much variety in style, size, weight, and so on.
Most concordant designs tend to be rather calm and formal.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-34-58.png]]

*Conflicting*: combine typefaces that are similar

Most of the time it looks like a mistake. *Conflict should be avoided.*

-----




[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-38-18.png]]

*Contrasting*: combine separate typefaces and elements that are clearly distinct from each other.

Strong contrast attracts our eyes.

-----

There are six clear and distinct ways to contrast type: size, weight, structure, form, direction, and color.
Most often you will *strengthen the effect by combining and emphasizing the differences.*

-----

* Type Categories

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-39-27.png]]

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-41-10.png]]

If you're setting lots of type that *you want people to actually read*, choose an oldstyle.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-43-03.png]]
Moderns tend to have *a cold, elegant look.*
Have *a striking appearance, especially when set very large.*
Most moderns are *not good choices for extended amounts of body copy.*

-----


[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-44-39.png]]

At first, advertiers took modern typefaces and made the thicks thicker.
Slab serifs *have little or no thick/thin transition.*
Slab serifs are *often used in children's books because of their clean, straightforward look.*

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-45-05.png]]
*Invest in a sans serif family that includes a strong, heavy, black face.*

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-48-14.png]]

*should never be set as long blocks of text and never as all caps.*
But scripts *can be particularly stunning when set very large* — don’t be a wimp!

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-48-41.png]]

They’re *fun, distinctive, easy to use, oftentimes cheaper,*
and there is a font for any whim you wish to express.

-----

* Type Contrasts

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_17-16-18.png]]

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-54-14.png]]

An important part of what compels you is *the contrast of very small type on that large page.*

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-56-02.png]]

Use *a contrast of size in unusual and provocative ways.*

If you use an item in an unusual size, see if you can repeat that concept elsewhere in the publication to create an attractive and useful repetition.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-57-36.png]]

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-57-48.png]]

When combining weights, remember the rule: *Don’t be a wimp.*

You will never be able to get that beautiful, strong contrast *unless you have a typeface with big, solid strokes.*

-----

You are well on your way to a type solution if you choose two or more faces from two or more categories

*Do not put two typefaces from the same category on the same page.*

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_17-07-10.png]]

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_17-08-56.png]]

We recognize words not only by their letters, but by their forms, the shapes of the entire words.
All words that are set *in capital letters have a similar rectangular form*, and *we are forced to read the words letter by letter.*

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_17-09-55.png]]

Type slanting upward to the right creates a positive energy.
Type slanting downward creates a negative energy.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_17-13-57.png]]

But there is another form of "direction".
Every element of type has a direction, even though it may run straight across the page.

You can involve other parts of your layout *in the contrast of type direction,*
such as graphics or lines, to emphasize or contrast the direction.

-----

* Typography

| One space after .       | Putting two spaces is old-style               | =Put one space._After punctuation.= |

| . in or out parentheses | whether content is a part of sentence or not  | =Blah(something).= =Blah(Blah.)=    |

-----

*Either indent new paragraphs or use extra space between paragraphs, not both*.
Following the logic of the above, *first paragraph following a heading or subhead does not need an indent*.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-03-31.png]]

When the last line of a paragraph has fewer than seven (more or less, depending on the length of the line) characters,
that last line is a *widow*.

When the last line of a paragraph, be it ever so long, ends at the top of the next column or page all by itself,
abandoned by the rest of its text, that is an *orphan*.

To avoid widows and orphans, you might need to *rewrite copy, or at least add or delete a word or two.*

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_15-57-08.png]]

*Kerning*: if you are aspiring to a professional level, you need to learn to manually adjust the spacing.

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_16-05-21.png]]

Setting text in a frame or box:
*Leave plenty of room on all sides*.
Generally create the visual impression that there is *the same amount of space on all sides*.

-----

* Print Works

(This chapter are written roughly because I'm not directly releated to this sorts of works)

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_15-12-31.png]]

Because each booklet is completely redesigned, it was critical that there be something
to tie them all together

One of the most important features of an identity package or branding follows
*the Principle of Repetition*

-----

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-04-02_15-14-12.png]]

One element should be dominant(the pencil-legged gentleman logo in this case),
and it should be dominant in the same way on the letterhead, the envelope, and the business card.

After the focal point, *use strong subheads* (strong visually and strong in what it says)
*so readers can quickly scan the flyer* to determine the point of the message

The white space needs to be as organized as the visible elements.
Let it be there, and let it flow.

*First paragraphs*, even after subheads, *should not be indented*.
When you do indent, use the standard *typographic indent of one "em" space*.

The Helvetica or Arial that came with your computer isn't bold enough to create a strong contrast.

*Invest in a sans serif family that includes a heavy black version as well as a light version*
(such as Eurostile, Formatat, Syntax, Frutiger, or Myriad)

*try a classic oldstyle serif face* (such as Garamond, Jenson, Caslon, Minion, or Palatino),
or a lightweight slab serif(such as Clarendon, Bookman, Kepler, or New Century Schoolbook)

It's important to be aware of the folds; you don't want important information disappearing into the creases.
If you have a strong alignment for the text on each panel of the brochure, however, feel free to
let the graphics cross over the space between the columns of text(the gutter) and into the fold
