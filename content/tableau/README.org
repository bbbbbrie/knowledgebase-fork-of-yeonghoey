* How-to
** Use Level of Detail Expressions
- ~{FIXED [Department] : AVG([Sales])}~ ::
  the average ~Sales~ per ~Department~
- ~{INCLUDE [Item] : AVG([Sales])}~ ::
  the average ~Sales~ at the level of detail defined in the view but includes the dimension ~Item~
- ~{EXCLUDE [Category] : AVG([Sales])}~ ::
  the average ~Sales~ at the level of detail defined in the view but does not include the dimension ~Category~

Consider a dataset like:
#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {"Developer": "foo", "Language": "Python"}
  {"Developer": "foo", "Language": "R"}
  {"Developer": "bar", "Language": "Go"}
#+END_SRC

Use LOD Expressions to answer **How many users use how many languages?**

** Create a dimension of Top N and Others
- To achieve this, we need to create a set first, and ~IF~ expression with it.

First off, it's better to create a parameter for adjusting ~N~:

You can test whether or not to do correctly by putting the set and the field on Row Shelf:
