*** lost+found
- http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18154/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-lostfound-folder-in-linux-and-unix

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The thing is, the file had a name and location once, but that information is no longer available.
So ~fsck~ deposits the file in a specific directory, called ~lost+found~
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Files that appear in ~lost+found~ are typically files that were already unlinked (i.e. their name had been erased)
but still opened by some process (so the data wasn't erased yet)when the system halted suddenly (kernel panic or power failure).
If that's all that happened, these files were slated for deletion anyway, you don't need to care about them.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On many filesystems, the ~lost+found~ directory is a bit special
because it preallocates a bit of space for ~fsck~ to deposit files there. (...)
If you accidentally delete ~lost+found~, *don't re-create it with* ~mkdir~, *use* ~mklost+found~ *if available*.
#+END_QUOTE

** Inode Structure
- http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4402/what-is-a-superblock-inode-dentry-and-a-file

[[file:img/screenshot_2017-03-02_22-48-52.png]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
inodes starts at number 2 (root)

inode12(dir_1)’s count is 2, because it’s parent and self-reference(.) pointing it.
root(2) is only exception(expected 3 but 4), *because it’s pointed by superblock*;

The *superblock* is essentially file system metadata and defines the file system type, size, status, and
information about other metadata structures (metadata of metadata).

** NUMA
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access

Non-uniform memory access.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A system can starve several processors at the same time,
notably because only one processor can access the computer's memory at a time.(...)
NUMA attempts to address this problem by providing separate memory for each processor,
avoiding the performance hit when several processors attempt to address the same memory.

#+END_EXAMPLE

- ~rrqm/s~, ~wrqm/s~  :: read/write requests merged per second

- ~r/s~, ~w/s~, ~rMB/s~, ~wMB/s~ :: reads/writes (throughput) per second

- ~avgrq-sz~ :: Average request size in sectors (512 bytes)
  In general if this number is below 16 (16 * 512 bytes = 8KB).
  If this number is low (<50), you are going to be IOPS limited.
  If it's high (>100), you are likely to be bandwidth limited.

- ~avgqu-sz~ :: Average queue size.
  Indicates how many requests are queued waiting to be serviced.
  If ~avgqu-sz~ gets big (>30), your application is submitting more requests per secondthan the volume can handle.

- ~await~ :: Average wait in milliseconds.
  The average amount of time the requests that were completed during this period waited
  from when they entered the queue to when they were serviced. 
  This number is a combination of the queue length and the average service time.

- ~svctm~ :: Service time in milliseconds.
  While ~await~ counts the whole wait time of requests, ~svctm~ counts only the time consumed by device.
  As Linux doesn't measure the actual service time, so ~svctm~ is just approximation.
  Consider ~await~ more importantly.

- ~%util~ ::
  Percentage of CPU time during whchi I/O requests were issed to the device. 
  High ~%util~ doesn't always say that there is an overload.
  If the device serves requests in parallel, this value can constantly be high.
