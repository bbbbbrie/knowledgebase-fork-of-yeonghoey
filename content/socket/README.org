* connect
- If ~connect()~ fails, the state of the socket is unspecified.

* EINTR
- POSIX specification defines that when signal (such as ~Ctrl+C~) is caught, ~recv~ returns ~EINTR~ error.
- When ~Ctrl+C~ is pressed in this case,
  1. signal handler is executed, 'stop' is set to 1,
  2. ~recv~ returns ~EINTR~
- Using ~SA_RESTART~ within the signal handler, it's possible to make the functions not return ~EINTR~ and just retry.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  volatile int stop = 0;

  void handler (int)
  {
    stop = 1;
  }

  void event_loop (int sock)
  {
    signal (SIGINT, handler);

    while (1) {
      if (stop) {
        printf ("do cleanup\n");
        return;
      }

      /* What if signal handler is executed at this point?
         This may be a problem, or not. 
       */

      char buf [1];
      int rc = recv (sock, buf, 1, 0);
      if (rc == -1 && errno == EINTR)
        continue;
      printf ("perform an action\n");
    }
  }
