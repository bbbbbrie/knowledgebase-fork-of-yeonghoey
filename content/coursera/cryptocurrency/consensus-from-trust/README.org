#+TITLE: Programming Assignment: Consensus from Trust

Because I'm not familiar with Java and not eager to learn bitcoin seriously,
I only wrote a simple solution just for passing the assignment.

To run locally:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  javac Simulation.java && java -ea Simulation .3 .45 .10 10
  #                               └─ -enableassertion
#+END_SRC
